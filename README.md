# Notes for reviewe:
- Project took about 8 hours (full working day including breaks for meetings and lunch)
- Pooling was purposefully not implemented
- PlayerPrefabs were purposefully not used for saving
- Programmable animations were purposefully picked instead of Animators due to this being a programmming demo
- No effects were added beyond the animation to avoid spending too much time on art
- No art was added even though a sprite setup was originally placed it was not 100% completed (the scaling will deform it but it could be fixed by centering the art instead)
- Generally speaking shortcuts were taking due to this being a demo and not a real project however code quality was preserved
